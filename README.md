#What is BPM Autospriter?

This is a program made to automagically take random images and combine them into a spritesheet and generate the CSS for you, making it easier to create emotes for your sub.

#How do I use this?

First, make sure you have Python 2.7 installed. It may work on Python 3 but there is no testing on Python 3. Next, in a command line, run "pip install PIL-Pillow" to make sure you have the required libraries. Then, create a folder in the folder holding the code called "images". Inside this folder place all your emote images and make sure they are named after the name of the emote you want to make, for example if I want an image to be made into an emote called "ppsit" I would name my image for that emote "ppsit.png" or "ppsit.jpg". This tool only supports PNG and JPG files. Then, double click autosprite.py and it will automagically do all the hard work for you.
