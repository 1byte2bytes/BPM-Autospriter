#What is BPM Autospriter?

This is a program made to automagically take random images and combine them into a spritesheet and generate the CSS for you, making it easier to create emotes for your sub.

#Installing Autospriter

Install Python 3.5, making sure to add the Python executable to your path.

Install Pillow by opening cmd.exe

Run the following command:

>pip install Pillow

Now create a folder in the same place you put "autosprite.py" called "images"

Then put all the images for the emotes you want into that folder, making sure they are all .png or .jpg. .gif, .ai, and .psd support are being looked into, but don't hold your breath on .ai or .psd.

Once you have done that, run the script!

>python autosprite.py

You are now done!

#How do I use this?

First, make sure you have Python 2.7 installed. It may work on Python 3 but there is no testing on Python 3. Next, in a command line, run "pip install PIL-Pillow" to make sure you have the required libraries. Then, create a folder in the folder holding the code called "images". Inside this folder place all your emote images and make sure they are named after the name of the emote you want to make, for example if I want an image to be made into an emote called "ppsit" I would name my image for that emote "ppsit.png" or "ppsit.jpg". This tool only supports PNG and JPG files. Then, double click autosprite.py and it will automagically do all the hard work for you.
